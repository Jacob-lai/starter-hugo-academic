  description: An advanced dual-delivery scaffold loading with angiogenic and osteogenic peptides (AP and OP) was fabricated via Cryogenic 3D printing. Such scaffolds not only were structurally and mechanically similar to cancellous bone but also improved bone regeneration with enhanced vascularization in vivo.

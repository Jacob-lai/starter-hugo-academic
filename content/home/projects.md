  description: 4D cell printing was used to fabricate dual-information delivery, self-folding, and cell-laden scaffolds for tubular tissue regeneration. The scaffolds could automatically fold into a tube upon heating to the human body temperature. The released information from the scaffolds could induce the differentiation of stem cells into smooth muscle cells.

  description: A dual-drug delivery and cell-laden scaffold were developed via hybrid 3D bioprinting of a synthetic polymer loading Doxorubicin hydrochloride and a natural hydrogel loading 5-fluorouracil and living cells. Such hybrid scaffolds showed heterogeneous structures, shape-retaining ability, controlled release of anti-cancer drugs for cancer ablation and suppression, and high cell viability and good cell growth encapsulated in the scaffolds.

  description: A versatile strategy was proposed to develop a shape morphing hydrogel composed of alginate and methylcellulose with swelling anisotropy for 4D printing. A series of 2D patterns was 4D printed and could be deformed into different simple and complex 3D structures (e.g., tube, helix, double helix, and flowers) by responding to Calcium solution.

  description: A new strategy was developed to fabricate a bilayer structure comprising a poly(D,L-lactide-co-trimethylene carbonate) (PDLLA-co-TMC) scaffold for providing the shape morphing ability and a gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) scaffold for encapsulating and delivering growth factor.

  description: An advanced dual-delivery scaffold loading with angiogenic and osteogenic peptides (AP and OP) was fabricated via Cryogenic 3D printing. Such scaffolds not only were structurally and mechanically similar to cancellous bone but also improved bone regeneration with enhanced vascularization in vivo.
